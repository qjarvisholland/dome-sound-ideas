WIP max patches using extreme timestretching and randomization to create easily manipulated drones- 

VERSION 3.1
Latest stable patch, includes updates from 3.0 that were made during installation setup in conjunction with UNITY GAIN a 32.2 loudspeaker array
https://jessemejia.net/#/unitygain/

the patch was designed to be controlled via OSC , the "transport" slider is tuned to a 1024ppr encoder
it mangles a recording of electric piano played by Kevin Gwozdz with granular sampling and reverb to produce a series of pleasant drones with enough randomization to avoid ear fatigue

during the installation a second OSC controller directed the sound through a HOA ambisonic panner to be delivered over an ORION interface to unityGain

the patch may be unstable on lean computers
To use:
load the main max patch, select "open file" to the right of the visual keyboard, and load a sound file. 
Piano or acoustic recordings play nicely.
